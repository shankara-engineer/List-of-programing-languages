    <p>C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language developed by Microsoft as a core part of its .NET ecosystem. Designed to be both powerful and productive, C# blends features from C++ with the simplicity of languages like Java, making it highly versatile for a wide array of applications. It's prominently used for building Windows desktop applications, robust web applications with ASP.NET Core, cross-platform mobile apps using .NET MAUI (formerly Xamarin), and, most notably, for game development with the widely popular Unity engine. Benefitting from automatic memory management (garbage collection) and a rich set of libraries, C# provides developers with a highly efficient and secure environment for creating scalable, high-performance software across various platforms.</p>
