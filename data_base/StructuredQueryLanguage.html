       MySQL is a widely adopted open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that utilizes Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and manipulating data. Unlike NoSQL databases, MySQL stores data in a structured format, organizing it into tables with predefined rows and columns, where relationships between these tables are established through keys. Its popularity stems from its robust reliability, high performance, scalability, and ease of use, making it a cornerstone technology for countless web applications, including prominent platforms like WordPress, Drupal, and various e-commerce systems. MySQL supports full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity, and offers features like replication for high availability and data redundancy. Owned and supported by Oracle Corporation, MySQL continues to be a go-to solution for developers and enterprises seeking a powerful and dependable relational database.
