    <p>A paragraph is a fundamental unit of writing, serving as a self-contained block of text that elaborates on a single main idea or point. Typically, it begins with a topic sentence that introduces the central theme, followed by several supporting sentences that provide details, examples, explanations, or evidence to develop that idea fully. The goal of a well-constructed paragraph is to present a cohesive and focused thought, ensuring clarity and readability by logically transitioning between sentences to build a complete argument or description before moving on to a new topic in a subsequent paragraph.</p>
