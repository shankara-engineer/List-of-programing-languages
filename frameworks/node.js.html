    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Built on Google Chrome's highly performant V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js extends JavaScript's capabilities from client-side scripting to server-side development, command-line tools, and network applications. Its core strength lies in its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which enables it to efficiently handle a large number of concurrent connections with a single thread, making it ideal for building highly scalable, real-time applications like chat apps, streaming services, and APIs. The "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm fostered by Node.js allows developers to use a single language across the entire application stack, streamlining development and leveraging a vast ecosystem of reusable modules available through the Node Package Manager (npm).</p>
